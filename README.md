# DarkSouls-Helper
Dark Souls Helper is a project that consists of two solutions.

## 1. Overlay for Dark Souls: Remastered. 
This program displays:
- the player's death count;
- the player's death count from a specific boss (or just from mobs);
- the player's current location;
- the player's name;
- the server status (currently cannot be optional);

> The **"server status"** is required for the WebSocket connection with the second solution.

## 2. iOS app.
This app have two modes: **offline** and **online**. In **offline** mode, you can use a stats calculator to see how many souls are needed for a specific level and view the Dark Souls map. In **online** mode, you receive data from the overlay app, including synced death counts (overall and from bosses), your location (with lore available on the map), and your character stats.

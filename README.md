# DarkSouls-Helper
Dark Souls Helper â€“ a project consisting of two solutions.

The first is a desktop Windows application that functions as an overlay for Dark Souls: Remastered. It displays useful information such as total death count, deaths per specific boss, and current location. Additionally, it can act as a WebSocket server to communicate with the companion mobile app.

The second is an iOS mobile application designed to enhance your Dark Souls: Remastered experience. It allows you to track your total deaths and boss-specific deaths, check the required souls per level, and potentially unlock additional features such as mapping your journey, earning achievements for boss kills, and exploring game lore.
